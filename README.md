# Dotfiles

This repo is mainly used for speeding up the post-installation process of my
arch linux setup.

## Setup

After cloning this repo, run `install` to install the applications using these
dotfiles and setting up the _.config_ folder.

The install script uses the [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.
